## Organization

We've separated the backend into several folders where :
- `/route` contains all the routes of our project and where each route (the same route as the frontend) is connected to a controller.
- `/controller` contains the main functionalities of a certain entity.
- `/config` contains the database configuration to establish a good connection with the backend (used in app.js).
